Business Requirements Document (BRD) - Chocolate Sales & Shipment Analytics
1. Introduction
This document outlines the business requirements for a new analytics dashboard designed to provide key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations for a comprehensive overview of sales, profitability, and operational performance. The dashboard will serve as a single source of truth for critical business metrics, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.

2. Scope
The project focuses on the development of a user-friendly dashboard that presents a set of predefined KPIs and charts. The data will be refreshed regularly to ensure timely and accurate insights.

3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard will prominently display the following KPIs as single, high-level metrics for a selected time period:

Total Amount: The sum of all sales revenue.

Total Boxes: The total number of boxes shipped.

Shipment Count: The total number of unique shipments made.

Total Profit: The total net profit.

Profit Percentage: The ratio of total profit to total revenue, expressed as a percentage.

Calculation: Total Profit / Total Amount * 100

4. Charts and Visualizations
The dashboard will include the following interactive charts to provide deeper insights and trend analysis:

4.1. Sales and Boxes Year-over-Year Comparison
Description: A combined visualization, likely a dual-axis line chart or two separate charts, that compares the total sales amount and the total number of boxes shipped from the current year against the same metrics for the previous year.

Purpose: To easily identify growth trends, seasonal patterns, and compare sales and operational volume against historical data.

4.2. Amount by Countries
Description: A map visualization or a bar chart that displays the total sales amount broken down by country.

Purpose: To understand geographical sales distribution and identify key markets.

4.3. Shipment Distribution
Description: A visualization (e.g., a pie chart or bar chart) showing the breakdown of shipments by key dimensions such as product category, shipping carrier, or destination region.

Purpose: To analyze shipping patterns and optimize logistics.

4.4. Top 6 Sales Persons
Description: A bar chart or a table ranking the top 6 salespersons based on total sales amount for a selected period.

Purpose: To recognize high-performing sales team members and encourage healthy competition.

4.5. Top 6 Products

Purpose: To identify the most popular and profitable products, which can inform inventory management and marketing strategies.

4.6. Overall Information Summary
Description: A dedicated section of the dashboard that provides a quick, textual summary of the most critical business insights for the selected period. This may include a sentence on overall growth, highlights from the top performers, and a mention of any significant trends.

Purpose: To give stakeholders a concise, high-level overview without needing to analyze every single chart.
